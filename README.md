# Social Network Analysis

Familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of graph theory used in social network analysis through this [mini assignment](https://github.com/meghan14/social_network_analysis_using_graphtool/blob/master/mini_assignment/Mini_assignment_social_network_analysis.md) designed to give you a hands on approach to solve an interesting real-life problem. I would recommend going through the notes before attempting the assignment [.ipynb link](https://github.com/meghan14/social_network_analysis_using_graphtool/blob/master/mini_assignment/Mini_assignment_social_network_analysis.ipynb). 

Feel free to share your thoughts or buzz me in case you're stuck. Good luck! :)
